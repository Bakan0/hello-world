Git entry tutorial

My name is John Michael Voudouris.
I started Iron Golem Solutions on October 14, 2016.
I am currently a Systems Administrator for a global government contracting company.
I want to become an Elixir developer in my spare time. I want to find a way to write a simple Android application using Elixir, Erlang, and/or the Phoenix Framework.
